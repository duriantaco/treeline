### Change Impact Analysis

These modules would have the highest ripple effect if modified - changes here will impact many other parts of the codebase:

- **type_checker**: Would affect 1 modules
 -> Most notable dependents: models.dependency_analyzer
- **dependency_analyzer**: Would affect 1 modules
 -> Most notable dependents: models.__init__
- **core**: Would affect 1 modules
 -> Most notable dependents: models.__init__
- **config_manager**: Would affect 0 modules
- **__init__**: Would affect 0 modules

### Architectural Insights

- Multiple entry points detected - this appears to be a **multi-service architecture**
- Few core components - may indicate **tightly coupled code** or early stage development
- High average dependencies (5.1 per module) - consider **reducing coupling** between modules
- Shallow dependency chains (max depth 2) - **resilient to changes**
## Executive Summary

This section provides a high-level overview of your codebase's health, highlighting key metrics and areas needing attention.

- **Overall Health**: ⚠️ Needs attention
- **Function Count**: 145 functions across 33 files
- **Documentation Coverage**: 24.8% (36/145 functions have docstrings)
- **Complex Functions**: 12 functions with complexity > 10
- **Security Issues**: 0 potential security concerns
- **Top Issue Categories**: Duplication (437), Code_Smells (94), Style (59)

**Recommended Actions:**
- Refactor the top 3 complex functions
- Add docstrings to 109 undocumented functions

## Configuration Thresholds

This section lists the thresholds used to evaluate your code. These are the maximum allowed values for various metrics before an issue is flagged.

| Threshold | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum parameters per function | 5 |
| Maximum function length | 50 lines |
| Maximum nested blocks | 3 |
| Maximum cyclomatic complexity | 10 |
| Maximum cognitive complexity | 15 |
| Maximum line length | 100 characters |
| Maximum file length | 1000 lines |
| Maximum return statements | 4 |
| Maximum duplicated lines | 5 |

## Most Complex Functions

This section lists the functions with the highest complexity metrics, which may indicate areas that are hard to test, maintain, or understand.

### Understanding Complexity Metrics

#### Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity quantifies the number of linearly independent paths through a function's source code. In simple terms, it measures how many different routes the execution can take.


How it's calculated:

- Start with a base score of 1

- Add 1 for each of the following structures:

  - `if` statement

  - `for` loop

  - `while` loop

  - `except` block

- For boolean operations (e.g., `and`, `or`), add the number of conditions minus 1


For example, a function with two `if` statements, one `for` loop, and a condition like `a and b and c` would have a cyclomatic complexity of 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6.


A complexity above 10 is generally considered too high and a sign that the function should be refactored.

#### Cognitive Complexity

While cyclomatic complexity treats all decision points equally, cognitive complexity focuses on how difficult the code is for humans to understand, particularly looking at nested structures.


How it's calculated:

- Control flow structures (`if`, `for`, `while`) add 1 point at their base level

- Nesting increases the cost: each level of nesting adds an additional point

- Boolean operations add points based on the number of conditions


For example, a deeply nested `if` statement inside a `for` loop is penalized more heavily than sequential `if` statements.


A cognitive complexity above 15 suggests code that may be difficult to understand and maintain.

#### Which Metric Should You Use?

Both metrics are valuable but serve different purposes:

- **Cyclomatic Complexity** helps estimate testing effort (each path should be tested)

- **Cognitive Complexity** helps identify code that humans might find confusing


The functions listed below have high scores in one or both metrics, suggesting they might benefit from refactoring into smaller, more focused functions.

## Function Dependencies (Code Flow)

This section details how functions interact, showing which functions depend on others and vice versa. If you change a function, its dependents (functions that call it) may be impacted. Understanding this helps predict the ripple effects of modifications.

### Most Called Functions

These functions are depended upon by many others. Changing them could affect multiple parts of your codebase.

No significant call dependencies found within project code.


### Functions with Most Dependencies

These functions rely on many others. They might be complex hubs, and changes to their dependencies could affect them.

No significant dependencies found within project code.

### Circular Dependency Analysis

Circular dependencies can cause maintenance issues, initialization problems, and make testing difficult. Here are the circular dependencies detected in your code:

#### Module-Level Circular Dependencies

No module-level circular dependencies detected. Good job! 👍


#### Function-Level Circular Dependencies

No function-level circular dependencies detected. Good job! 👍
